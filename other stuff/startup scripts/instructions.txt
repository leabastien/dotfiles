Just make all these scripts start with your system
(~/.config/autostart)

Also make them executables

To make apps resize, move and hide title bar automatically on start:

move your window to were it needs to be
click on the 3 dots at top left of the window
more actions
window specific actions
detect window properties
click on your window
add size and position
then click close on the left
add properties
add "no titile bar and border"
switch no titile bar and border to yes
click apply
repeat for each app

(this only works if your app as a custom window name like "Resource Watcher")
